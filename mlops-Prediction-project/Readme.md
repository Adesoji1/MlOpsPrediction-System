# MLOps Prediction project
This is the final project for MLOps zoomcamp course. In this project,I considered the problem of customer sentiment analysis for a product on a website. The problem is described as "Given Review about clothing on E-commerce predict whether the customer will recommed it to her friends or not".After which i had to study the processes and pipeline involved in order to know how to build an efficient machine learning system for prediction.
